I am an M.Sc. Student in Mechanical Engineering at McGill University currently working on the acoustic interaction via impulsive loading in a piston-driver system for magnetized target fusion. In addition to my main research project, my undergraduate honours thesis involved investigating the plausibility of laser-ablation of interplanetary media during the acceleration phase of laser-driven interstellar travel. My undergradute and graduate research projects are under the supervision of Professor Andrew Higgins.
