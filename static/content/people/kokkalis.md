I am a senior honours Mechanical Engineering student at McGill University. My current research involves investigating the plausibility of laser-ablation of interplanetary media during the acceleration phase of laser-driven interstellar travel, under the supervision of Professor Andrew Higgins. Upon graduation, I hope to pursue graduate studies in aerospace engineering.
