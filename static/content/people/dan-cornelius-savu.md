The long-lost child of Thomas Shelby now turned into a McGill Master’s student, when he isn’t playing the odd tune or telling fortunes you can find him lost in thought exploring some ghastly rabbit hole while staring at the moon, the heavens, or both. His interests lie in theoretical and numerical work with emphasis on first principles, although he won’t shy away from a generous amount of elbow grease in the lab if called upon. He also enjoys petting light sails whenever he meets one.
