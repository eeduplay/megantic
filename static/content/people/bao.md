Zhuo Fan's research interests revolved around the physics of laser-thermal propulsion: as part of the research group, he developed 1- and 2-D steady-state models for the temperature profile of an LTP thrust chamber, and collaborated closely with Emmanuel to develop a spacecraft and Mars mission concept based on this propulsion system. Zhuo Fan is now pursuing a Master's degree at the University of Toronto, studying healthcare applications for microrobotics.
