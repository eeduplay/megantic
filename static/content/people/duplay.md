During my studies at McGill in the Mechanical Engineering department, I joined the Interstellar Flight research group to design a mission and spacecraft around the laser-thermal propulsion concept. Although I am now pursuing a [Master's degree in spaceflight at the Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/masters/aerospace-engineering/msc-aerospace-engineering/master-tracks/space-flight), I am still involved in laser-thermal propulsion research, notably by collaborating with the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory to refine our laser-sustained plasma model.
