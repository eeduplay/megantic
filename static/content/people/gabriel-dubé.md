Final year student in Aerospace Engineering at Polytechnique Montréal, particularly interested in advanced power and propulsion for interstellar applications. Extensive experience with student researched and developed (SRAD) hybrid rocket engines, having been Propulsion Lead, then Team Lead of the Oronos rocket team. With professor Higgins, I am starting the setup of our laser thermal rocket test bed. I am also preparing for a research campaign at a martian/lunar analog base in the arctic during August 2022, where I will be launching tethered balloons and drones for mapping and exploration operations. I plan to pursue a masters degree once I graduate from Polytechnique in December 2022.
