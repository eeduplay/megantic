In the past I've interned at CRIM and Expedia working on artificial intelligence and web development, respectively. I've also participated in robotics for several years. Using this experience, I'm currently working on web design, radiation cooling experiments and quadrupole ion traps. I plan on becoming an aerospace engineer in the future.
