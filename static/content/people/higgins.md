I am a professor of Mechanical Engineering, with Masters and PhD degrees in Aeronautics and Astronautics. At McGill University, I have taught courses on compressible flow, thermodynamics, combustion, and statistical mechanics. I have worked for 30 years on research in high-speed flow and shock waves for applications to aerospace propulsion and fusion energy, and now I am setting my sights higher by considering the engineering problems associated with interstellar flight. I am a surviving urban cyclist, an aspiring longboard surfer, and Iâ€™m learning to endure the Quebec winters with cross-country skiing.
