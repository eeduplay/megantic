I am an honors mechanical engineering student at McGill university.  My work has involved the design of interplanetary missions, astrodynamic calculations and finite element simulations to assess the feasibility of ultra-fast aerocapture maneuvers at Mars, focused on a laser thermal rocket for fast transit within the solar system. Current work involves an experimental study on the symmetric convergence of detonation waves, also under the supervision of Prof. Andrew Higgins.  Upon graduation, I plan to pursue a masters degree in aerospace engineering.
