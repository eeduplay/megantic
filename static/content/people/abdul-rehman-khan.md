I completed my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from McGill in Fall 2019 where I helped design and build the original Interstellar Shock Tube under the supervision of Dr. Higgins. I then moved to Auburn, Alabama to complete my Master's degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering from Auburn University, with a focus on Advanced Manufacturing. At Auburn, I was a Research Assistant at the Interdisciplinary Center for Advanced Manufacturing Systems (ICAMS) and restored a â€™66 Mustang as a personal project on the side. I now work at Lucid Motors in Newark, California as a Powertrain Advanced Manufacturing Engineer where I help design and build the fastest and longest-range drive units for arguably the hottest luxury electric cars on the planet.
