## Contributing
### Branches
`master` : Where our live site is running. Don't push anything other than a working `dev` branch there.
`dev` : Where we push all our changes for testing before publication.

#### Writing new pages/components etc.
1. Make a new branch from `dev` for your page or component.
2. Code away!
3. Once you're done, make a pull request back into `dev`

### Setting up your environment
You'll need to set up your development environment as described [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/) and clone this repository.

Once that's done, open the command line at the root of the repo and run:

```shell
  npm install ./
```

Aaaand you're ready to roll!
